## Part 1: Creating a JSON Rules File
Comments - Nice work.  They all look great except for the FiO2.  I don't see any information to tell us when to use A-a Gradient and when to use PaO2. (-1)

## Part 2: Functions to evaluate rules
Comments - Nice work creating a generic function to handle all the range-based rules.  The only one with a flaw is the FiO2 function.

## Part 3: Put it all together
Comments - Nice and simple.

## Part 4: Accessing and processing the patient file
Comments - Looks like you don't quite have the piece running, yet.  I got a couple of different errors like key name and comparing str and int.  You were generally on the right track, though. (-1)
